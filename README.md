# hbc-Reupload
Hey y‘all, normally i don’t have anything to do with the Homebrew scene, but since the hbc GitHub project could get taken down by Nintendo or could shutdown completely by the devs, i‘ve choosed to put all these files in a Google Drive file, if something happens with the original hbc upload.

I know that the current project has stolen code from Nintendo, but i don‘t really want to support the devs behind it, that stole this code. I do this, because either so more people can get it, when it gets taken down or the best choice, because so devs who have enough time can rewrite it from the ground-up. I hope i've could explain every question that came up to a few mind's.

I will provide the link to the hbc reupload and the original hbc project in thie README (i will also provide the ZIP file to download here directly, if anyone wants to).

The hbc Reupload on Google Drive with all the original files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MQCC8wgVKvtrjAsr_qOLWWoVWskZhGWR/view?usp=sharing
